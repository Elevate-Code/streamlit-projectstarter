When asked to do a database migration, write a migration function that can be run in the `main` block unless otherwise specified, including highly visible warnings about irreversible operations and concise safety recommendations for testing and rollback. For non-backwards compatible changes (e.g., dropping columns, changing nullability), add a very prominent "‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGE" warning with rollout steps to prevent production downtime.

If the code you are writing or editing has functions that have many lines of complex code for calculations, data processing, external dependencies, or critical business rules in any non-trivial way, consider writing a test for it. Prefix this suggestion in your response with a "üí°" emoji.

To minimize maintenance burden, when writing tests keep them small, simple and minimal unless specifically requested otherwise. Be sure to concisely document each test function with a single-sentence docstring explaining their testing intent.
