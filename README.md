## üö® Delete this top section after cloning üö®

To get started with this template, follow all the steps in the collapsible section below.

‚ö†Ô∏è After cloning, remove this entire section from your README.md file once you've cloned the repository and are ready to proceed with your project.

</summary>

1. Clone the repository with a different name:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Elevate-Code/streamlit-projectstarter.git {st-your-project-name}
   ```

2. Change into the cloned repository's directory:
   ```
   cd streamlit-new-project
   ```

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Remove the remote connection to the original repository:
   ```
   git remote remove origin
   ```

   This step decouples `streamlit-new-project` from `streamlit-projectstarter` by removing the remote connection to the original repository.

4. Make the desired changes to get your project to its initial stage:

   - Edit the `requirements.txt` file to match the initial dependencies you need for your project.
   - Check out the [streamlit_tips.md](streamlit_tips.md) file for how to use the debugger with VS Code or PyCharm and other tips.
   - Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`
   - Run `venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment
   - Run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` to ensure pip is up to date
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
   - To check for newer packages than what is locked in `requirements.txt`, run `pip list --outdated`
   - Run `python start_project.py` to create template .env files, then delete this script file as it is no longer needed.

5. Clear the git history and create a new initial commit:
   ```
   git checkout --orphan latest_branch
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -D master
   git branch -m master
   ```
   This sequence of commands creates a new branch without any history, adds all the files, creates a new initial commit, deletes the old master branch, and renames the new branch (latest_branch) to 'master'.

6. Create a new private repository on your personal GitHub account. You can do this by visiting https://github.com/new and filling in the repository details. Make sure to set the visibility to "Private".

   (Optional) If you want to publish the repository under an organization account, create the new private repository on the organization's page instead.

   You can create the repository by visiting `https://github.com/organizations/{your-org-name}/repositories/new`.

8. Set the remote URL of your local repository to point to the new private repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/{path-copied-from-new-repo}.git
   ```

9. Push your local changes to the new private repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

   üîÅ Refresh the GitHub page, and you should see the code from the template repository in your new private repository.

### Authentication with Google OAuth

This application uses Streamlit's native Google OAuth authentication for secure access control. For detailed setup instructions, see [Authentication Documentation](docs/authentication.md).

To enable authentication in your pages:

1. Add this code to the top of `app.py` and all other pages requiring authentication:
   ```python
   from auth import check_auth, render_user_info

   # Check authentication
   check_auth()

   # Optional: Show user info in sidebar
   render_user_info()
   ```

2. For pages that need role-based access (future feature):
   ```python
   from auth import require_auth

   @require_auth(roles=["admin"])
   def admin_only_page():
       st.write("Admin only content")
   ```

## Running & Developing the Project Locally

### .env file
Duplicate and rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` adding your own values.

### Initial Setup
Requires Python 3.8 or higher (check with `python --version`)
Requires `uv` CLI tool (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/#installation)
- Create a virtual environment using `uv venv --python ">=3.8"`
- Always run `.venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment (setup your IDE to do it automatically)
- Run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
- Run `python scripts/generate_secrets.py` to generate the Streamlit secrets file
- Run `streamlit run app.py` to start the server

### Ongoing Development
- Run `.venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always activate the virtual environment before running any commands
- Run `streamlit run app.py` to start the server
- To check for package updates, run `pip list --outdated` (may take a while)
- To add new packages, first add it to `requirements.txt` then run `uv pip sync requirements.txt`

### Authentication

This application uses Streamlit's native OAuth2 support for authentication. For detailed setup instructions, see [Authentication Documentation](docs/authentication.md).

## Deploying to Railway.app

### Prerequisite: Publish Repo to Organization GitHub

When you when I press "Publish to Github" the only options there appear are private and public repositories.

Recommended workflow with GitHub CLI:
- Ensure GitHub CLI is installed (https://cli.github.com/) and login via `gh auth login`
- Make sure you are in the root directory of the project
- `gh repo create Elevate-Code/your-repo-name --source . --private`

Or using GitHub desktop: Just click the "publish repository" and choose the organization to publish under.

Migrating from your personal to organization repo:
- Go to repository Settings > Transfer ownership to move it to Elevate-Code organization
- `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Elevate-Code/your-repo-name`

### Railway.app Setup

- [Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard) > New Project > Deploy from GitHub repo > Add variables
- Select Add variables, under **Variables**:
    - Add `PORT` with value `8501`
- Click `x` to close the open service, click project `Settings` and:
    - Update project name from auto-generated one, use repo name, click `Update`
    - (optional) Under **Shared Variables**, add variables from `.env` that might be used by multiple services
- Click on the service, then under **Settings**:
    - Note: If you see a "Failed build/deployment", this is expected at this stage.
    - Hover over the service name and click üìù to change it to "streamlit-app" or similar
    - Settings > Networking > Public Networking, click `Generate Domain`, port 8501
    - Change the public URL to something more user-friendly, or same as the repo name
    - If you have an issue with ports try the "magic suggestion"
    - Deploy > Custom Start Command, enter:
      - üîì Without auth: `streamlit run app.py`
      - üîí With auth: `python scripts/generate_secrets.py && streamlit run app.py`
- You should see a large banner that says "Apply n changes", click Deploy (takes about 5 minutes)
- You should now be able to view the app at the public URL
- For debugging deployment issues, in the service, under **Deployments**:
    - Click on the latest deployment > `View Logs`
    - Check `Build Logs` and `Deploy Logs` for errors
    - If it works fine locally but not on Railway, you can use the [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli) to debug

### Adding a Database
- Create a Postgres service
- View the DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL in Variables > Postgres, use this in your local `.env` file
- Connect other services to the Postgres service with PG_DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL}}


### Connecting to Railway Database with DBeaver

1. In DBeaver: New Database Connection > PostgreSQL > Connect by URL

2. Get the connection details from copying the Railway `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`:
   ```
   postgresql://${PGUSER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_DOMAIN}:${RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_PORT}/${PGDATABASE}
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres:abc123...@autorack.proxy.rlwy.net:59123/railway
   ```

3. Configure the connection:
   - **JDBC URL**: Convert the Railway URL to JDBC format:
     ```
     jdbc:postgresql://[RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_DOMAIN]:[RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_PORT]/[PGDATABASE]
     ```
     Example:
     ```
     jdbc:postgresql://autorack.proxy.rlwy.net:59123/railway
     ```
   - **Username**: Use the `PGUSER` value from Railway
   - **Password**: Use the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` value from Railway
   - **General** > **Connection name**: Use your project name for clarity

4. Your database tables will be located under:
   ```
   {Connection Name} > Databases > railway > Schemas > Public > Tables
   ```
